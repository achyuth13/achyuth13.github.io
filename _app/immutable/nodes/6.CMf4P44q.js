But everyday, I bet he didn't even know what he had the previous week. Why Einstein? When we backtrack, we don't know what happened everyday, we just remember some things, some events, some Nigazhvugal. Life as we know it is defined by these Nigazhvugal and quantified by the time in between. It's like the silence between notes. It's like that saying, a movie is just a climax delayed. What you can do and have to is, try and make your Urave that connects your Nigazhvugal to form your Vidhi, Thithikkum.
