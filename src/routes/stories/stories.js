People don\'t know what Einstein did everyday, they know when he published the General Theory Of Relativity. But everyday, I bet he didn\'t even know what he had the previous week. Why Einstein? When we backtrack, we don\'t know what happened everyday, we just remember some things, some events, some Nigazhvugal. Life as we know it is defined by these Nigazhvugal and quantified by the time in between. It\'s like the silence between notes. It\'s like that saying, a movie is just a climax delayed. What you can do and have to is, try and make your Urave that connects your Nigazhvugal to form your Vidhi, Thithikkum. What that means is, try to make your Bridge that connects your Events to form your Destiny, Sweet. Urave, Vidhiye, Thithikkum. Nigazhvugal.',

I don\'t think even he knew. something carefully is implanted in us. could be when we\'re born, when we see the world. this, most people call purpose. no one knows why you\'re doing the things that you\'re doing. you\'re just doing it. Life\'s taking you places, you can easily miss it if you don\'t pay attention. even those moments when you say my life, I\'m going to take control. even that is pre planned maybe. destiny, fate, kismat, vidhi, many words. no one knows why it\'s happening. that my friend is the most exciting, exhilarating, and exhaustive why that can ever exist in this ever expansive, but unidirectional human consciousness. i was just thinking, what is mine? my body? it\'s from the land. my intelligence? that\'s just memory. my soul? it\'s a part of the universe. what. is. mine? the Time that I\'ve travelled through this fabric of space-time will forever remain, as mine.
