        Needless to say, I'm a true-blue Bangalorean, grew up my entire life
        here. Not only the weather, I love everything about it.

        I work as an SDE-2 at Nuclei. I've contributed in managing, optimizing
        and securing our Android SDK. I've also built categories in Svelte.

        Outside of work, I play the violin. I'm also an active part of our band <span

        videos and movies that I've written, someday.
