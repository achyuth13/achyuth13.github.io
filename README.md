# All About Me

I write code, music and blogs, not necessarily in that order.

When I write code - it's majorly for Android applications and Svelte but I've been learning Go, really enjoying it. And when it's music, it's for my band Caramel Chutney, I play the violin there and we write originals.

Over the years I've realised that the dichotomy of having both tech and music has really bought the best out of me and is continuing to do so. 

This website is my personal portfolio of code, music and blogs I've written.
